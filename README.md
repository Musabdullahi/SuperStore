# *Data Sourcing*
This step discusses the raw form of the SuperStore dataset as follows:  
* The Superstore dataset is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).  
* It consists of 21 Columns including: Row ID,	Order ID,	Order Date,	Ship Date,	Ship Mode,	Customer ID,	Customer Name,	Segment,	Country,	City,	State,	Postal Code,	Region,	Product ID,	Category,	Sub-Category,	Product Name,	Sales,	Quantity,	Discount &	Profit.
* It consists of 9,994 rows and 1 row as header-row.

------------------------------------
# *Data Transformation*
Power Query from Excel was utilized to clean and transform the data to address:  
* Duplicate values: There was no duplicate row found.
* Missing values or errors: There was none found.
* Inconsistency in datatype: Columns were formatted to appropriate datatype.
* Inconsistency in date formats: Date columns were converted from text to date.
* Removal of unnecessary data: 3 unnecsssary columns were removed; Row ID column was removed since it is the same as Excel column label. Country column was also removed since this data is based in only one country 'United States'. Postal Code column was also removed since it isn't useful for this analysis.
